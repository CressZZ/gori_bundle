* @author Gary Little\n * @fileoverview\n * The library creates and manages per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers.\n * <p>\n * This is an enhanced V3 implementation of the\n * <a href=\"http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V2 MarkerClusterer</a> by Xiaoxi Wu. It is based on the\n * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n */\n\n/**\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @name ClusterIconStyle\n * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.

The <code>styles</code> array element used has an index of\n *  <code>index</code> minus 1. For example, the default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n *  <code>text</code> value of <code>\"125\"</code> and an <code>index</code> of <code>3</code>\n *  for a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the <code>styles</code>\n *  array is <code>2</code>.

Icons such\n * as these look better when viewed on high-resolution monitors such as Apple's Retina displays.\n * Note: if this property is <code>true</code>, sprites cannot be used as cluster icons.\n * @property {number} [batchSize=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE] Set this property to the\n *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch when using a browser other than\n *  Internet Explorer (for Internet Explorer, use the batchSizeIE property instead).\n * @property {number} [batchSizeIE=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE_IE] When Internet Explorer is\n *  being used, markers are processed in several batches with a small delay inserted between\n *  each batch in an attempt to avoid Javascript timeout errors.

@fileoverview\n * The library creates and manages per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers.\n * <p>\n * This is an enhanced V3 implementation of the\n * <a href=\"http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V2 MarkerClusterer</a> by Xiaoxi Wu. It is based on the\n * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n */\n\n/**\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @name ClusterIconStyle\n * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor. The element in this array that is used to\n *  style the cluster icon is determined by calling the <code>calculator</code> function.\n *\n * @property {string} url The URL of the cluster icon image file. Required.\n * @property {number} height The display height (in pixels) of the cluster icon. Required.\n * @property {number} width The display width (in pixels) of the cluster icon. Required.\n * @property {Array} [anchorText] The position (in pixels) from the center of the cluster icon to\n *  where the text label is to be centered and drawn. The format is <code>[yoffset, xoffset]</code>\n *  where <code>yoffset</code> increases as you go down from center and <code>xoffset</code>\n *  increases to the right of center. The default is <code>[0, 0]</code>.\n * @property {Array} [anchorIcon] The anchor position (in pixels) of the cluster icon. This is the\n *  spot on the cluster icon that is to be aligned with the cluster position. The format is\n *  <code>[yoffset, xoffset]</code> where <code>yoffset</code> increases as you go down and\n *  <code>xoffset</code> increases to the right of the top-left corner of the icon. The default\n *  anchor position is the center of the cluster icon.\n * @property {string} [textColor=\"black\"] The color of the label text shown on the\n *  cluster icon.\n * @property {number} [textSize=11] The size (in pixels) of the label text shown on the\n *  cluster icon.\n * @property {string} [textDecoration=\"none\"] The value of the CSS <code>text-decoration</code>\n *  property for the label text shown on the cluster icon.\n * @property {string} [fontWeight=\"bold\"] The value of the CSS <code>font-weight</code>\n *  property for the label text shown on the cluster icon.\n * @property {string} [fontStyle=\"normal\"] The value of the CSS <code>font-style</code>\n *  property for the label text shown on the cluster icon.\n * @property {string} [fontFamily=\"Arial,sans-serif\"] The value of the CSS <code>font-family</code>\n *  property for the label text shown on the cluster icon.\n * @property {string} [backgroundPosition=\"0 0\"] The position of the cluster icon image\n *  within the image defined by <code>url</code>. The format is <code>\"xpos ypos\"</code>\n *  (the same format as for the CSS <code>background-position</code> property).
